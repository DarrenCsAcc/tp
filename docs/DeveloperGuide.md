### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Applicant` object residing in the `Model`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TrackAScholarParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an applicant).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TrackAScholarParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TrackAScholarParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores TrackAScholar data i.e., all `Applicant` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueApplicantList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Applicant` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `TrackAScholarBook`, which `Applicant` references. This allows `TrackAScholar` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Applicant` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both TrackAScholar data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TrackAScholarStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.trackascholar.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add applicant feature

#### Implementation

The add operation is facilitated by `AddCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `add n/Sam p/98886767 e/sam@example.com s/NUS Merit Scholarship as/pending`, for example, to add a new applicant.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `add` and
   the arguments `n/Sam p/98886767 e/sam@example.com s/NUS Merit Scholarship as/pending`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `add` command and `AddCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `AddCommandParser#parse()`
   to map the various arguments via their prefixes (e.g. `Sam` is mapped using prefix `n/`).

3. `AddCommandParser#parse()` will then call `AddCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent()` to ensure that all mandatory prefixes are present
   in the user input, after which the various arguments will be retrieved via the prefixes and parsed into their respective attributes.

4. `AddCommandParser#parse()` creates a new `Applicant` with the various attributes before finally initializing and returning an `AddCommand`
   with the new `Applicant` as an argument.

5. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `AddCommand#execute()`, which invokes `Model#hasApplicant()` to check if the new `Applicant` is a
   duplicate of any applicant already stored in TrackAScholar. When the check has concluded and no duplicate was found, `Model#addApplicant()`
   is called to add the new `Applicant` into TrackAScholar.

6. `AddCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing details about the applicant's successful addition to TrackAScholar.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add` Command example](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add command:

![Add command activity diagram](images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Filter application status feature

#### Implementation

The filter operation is facilitated by `FilterCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `filter pending`, for example, to filter out applicants with pending scholarship application status.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `filter` and
   the argument `pending`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `filter` command and `FilterCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `FilterCommandParser#parse()`
   which checks that the argument is a valid application status by calling `ApplicationStatus#isValidApplicationStatus()`.

3. After passing the check, `FilterCommandParser#parse()` creates a new `ApplicationStatusPredicate` with the argument before finally initializing and returning a `FilterCommand`
   with the new `ApplicationStatusPredicate` as an argument.

4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `FilterCommand#execute()`, which invokes `Model#updateFilteredApplicantList()` to filter out the list of
   applicants with the matching application status. When the operation has concluded, `Model#getFilteredApplicantList()`
   is called to retrieve the filtered list, such that TrackAScholar can count the total number of applicants in that particular list.

5. `FilterCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing details of how many applicants were found with a matching scholarship application status.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `filter` Command example](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a filter command:

![Filter command activity diagram](images/FilterCommandActivityDiagram.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Sort applicants by name, scholarship or status feature.

#### Implementation

The sort operation is facilitated by `SortCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `sort name`, for example, to sort all applicants by name in ascending lexicographic order.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `sort` and
   the argument `name`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `sort` command and `SortCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `SortCommandParser#parse()`
   which checks if the arguments have the valid parameter name and flag by calling `List#contains()` and `SortCommandParser#checkInputSizeAndReverseFlag()` respectively.

3. After passing the check, `SortCommandParser#parse()` creates a new `Comparator<Applicant>` with the argument before finally initializing and returning a `SortCommand`
   with the new `Comparator<Applicant>` as an argument.

4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `SortCommand#execute()`, which invokes `Model#updateFilteredApplicantList()` to filter out the list of
   applicants with the matching application status. When the operation has concluded, `Model#getFilteredApplicantList()`
   is called to retrieve the filtered list, such that TrackAScholar can count the total number of applicants in that particular list.

5. `SortCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing the newly sorted applicant list according to the input parameters.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

![Filter command activity diagram](images/FilterCommandActivityDiagram.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Remove applicants by application status feature

#### Implementation

The remove operation is facilitated by `RemoveCommand`. It extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the remove operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `remove accepted`, for example, to remove all applicants with accepted scholarship application status.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `remove` and
   the argument `accepted`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `remove` command and `RemoveCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `RemoveCommandParser#parse()`.

3. `RemoveCommandParser#parse()` now parses the argument and creates a new `ApplicationStatus` before finally initializing and returning a `RemoveCommand`
   with the new `ApplicationStatus` as an argument.

4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `RemoveCommand#execute()`, which invokes `RemoveCommand#promptUserConfirmation()`. TrackAScholar now displays
   a window asking for the user's confirmation to remove the applicants. After the user confirms, `RemoveCommand#confirmRemove()` is called which
   in turn calls `Model#removeApplicant()` to remove all applicants from the list matching the targeted `ApplicationStatus`.

5. `FilterCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing information of the successful removal.

The following sequence diagram shows how the remove operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `remove` Command example](images/RemoveSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The GUI interactions when `RemoveCommand#execute()` calls `RemoveCommand#promptUserConfirmation()`
is abstracted out as this sequence diagram aims only to demonstrate the interactions inside Logic Component for the `remove` command.
